/*Mr Akshay is playing with lines he is drawing lines with some height,imagin that two lines that together with the 
x-axis form a container, then find, with given integer heights maximum amount of water akshay can store,
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the
ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
input :
number of lines n
n integer values of height of each line
output:
maximum water a container can store

Example 
case 1:
input :
9
1 8 6 2 5 4 8 3 7
output= 49



Explanation :
 first line height is 1 second line height is 8 like that last line height is 7, so akshay can store water between second line and last line with the height of 7
 distance between last and second line is 7 so maximum capacity is 7*7=49
 note : if we consider two 8 lines i.e at position 2 and 7 then the height of container is 8 and distance of container is 5 so water capacity is 8 * 5 = 40
 hence 49 is the maximum capacity returned.

Case 2:
input =9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
output = 20
explanation :water is stored between line with height 5 and line with height 9 so height of container is 5 and width of container is 4 hence 5 * 4= 20
case 3:
input=10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 8 10
output=20
